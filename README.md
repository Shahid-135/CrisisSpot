## CrisisSpot 
We propose a novel framework, **CrisisSpot**, designed to effectively identify crisis-related information. It consists of four integral components:

1. **Feature Extraction and Interaction Module:** Orchestrates interaction between text and visual modalities via an IDEA attention mechanism.

2. **Multimodal Graph Learning:** Enriches features extracted from a multimodal encoder and reconstructs the enriched features through a GraphSAGE layer.

3. **Social Context Feature Extraction:** Extracts diverse attributes such as crisis-related information and user interaction history, quantified by metrics like User Informative Score (UIS), Crisis Informative Score (CIS), sentiment polarity, and User Engagement.

4. **Multimodal Fusion Module:** Processes fused features from the previous modules, integrating them via a Joint Fusion Learning Network for effective crisis-related information discernment.
